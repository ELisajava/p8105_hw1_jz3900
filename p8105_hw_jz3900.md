This is my R Markdown file for P8105 HW1 (jz3900)

Load the tidyverse function for HW1

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

# Problem 1

The task involves providing a brief description of the penguins dataset,
which includes:

- The data in the dataset, including the names and values of important
  variables

- The size of the dataset

- The mean flipper length

- Creating a scatterplot

Load the penguins dataset from the “palmerpenguins” package:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## Names of the dataset

``` r
names(penguins)
```

    ## [1] "species"           "island"            "bill_length_mm"   
    ## [4] "bill_depth_mm"     "flipper_length_mm" "body_mass_g"      
    ## [7] "sex"               "year"

It shows that the names in the penguins dataset are: bill_depth_mm,
bill_length_mm, body_mass_g, flipper_length_mm, island, sex, species,
year.

## The size of the dataset

The size of the dataset is 344 rows and 8 columns

## The mean flipper length

The mean flipper length is 200.9152047
